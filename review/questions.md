# Questions

1. If I want to store a whole number of 4 billion, which data type would I use?
2. If I want to make a quiz program and I need a variable for the answer, which is a single letter. What data type would I use?
3. Is this allowed? `int negativeNumber = -125000;`
4. If I am writing a program to sing the song “99 bottles of beer on the wall”, which counts down from 99 to 0 as the bottles fall off the wall and break. What data type can I use for the variable bottles ?
5. A variable name can contain a dot (full stop). True or False?
6. A variable name can be any word I choose. True or False?
7. A variable name cannot have a number as the first character e.g. 1number. True or False?

8. What will be printed here?

```java
public class Question {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println(10 > 9);

9. There is one mistake in this code. Can suggest the correction?

```java
public class Question {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int number = 1;

        if (Number == 300) {
            System.out.println("Correct number");
        }

        String name = "Paul";
        String myName = "Angela";

    }

    public static void speak(String name) {
        System.out.println("I am " + name);
    }
}
```

```java
class Question {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int myAge = 18;
        boolean oldEnough = checkAge(myAge);
        System.out.println(oldEnough);
    }

    public static boolean checkAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 18) {
            return true;
        }

{
    public static void myMethod(int x, int y) {
        int z = 4;
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        if (x< y) {
            z += 4;
        }
        if (x * x > y) {
            z += 2;
        }
        else {
            z += 6;
        }
        z++;
        System.out.print(z);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        myMethod(3, 9);
    }
}
```

22. We want to check in Java whether the value of an integer variable x is between integers 5 and 10, including both.
Mark all the correct answers:

- [ ] 5 <= x <= 10
- [ ] 4 < x < 11
- [ ] 5 ≤ x ≤ 10
- [ ] 5 <= x && x <= 10
- [ ] 5 =< x && x =< 10
- [ ] 5 <= x || x <= 10
- [ ] 4 < x && !(x > 10)
- [ ] !(x < 5 || 10 < x)
- [ ] 5 ≤ x && x ≤ 10

## Coding

23. Write a method which returns which of two numbers is the smaller one.
The method shall return `-1` it the first number is the smaller one, `0` if both number are equal and `1` if the second number is the smaller one.
The signature of this method shall look like this:

```java
public static int compare(double number1, double number2)
```

24. Write two methods.
- One method takes the age of a person as input and returns if this person is an adult or not.
- Write a second method which prints “Please enter” or “You have to stay outside” dependent from the result of this method.

The two methods shall have the following signatures:

```java
public static boolean isAdult(int age)
public static void canEnter(boolean isAdult)
```

25. Extend the method public bool `isAdult(int age)` to a method with this signature `boolean isAdult(int age, string country)`.

Implement a second method `getMinAdultAge(String country)` which returns the age a person needs to have to be an adult in this country. Use this age to evaluate if a person is an adult in the given country. Implement the second method for at least 2 different countries.

26. Write a mthod to calculate the area of a circle:

`A = π * r²`

27. Write a method which calculates the volume of a cylinder.

For this task, we want to reuse our method calculating the area of a circle.
The volume of a cylinder is:

`V = area-of-circle * height`

The method shall have the following signature:

```java
public static double calculateCylinderVolume(double radius, double height)
```
