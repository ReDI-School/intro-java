# Glossary
A collection of common terms used in Java programming

<dl>
    <dt><b>Compiler</b></dt>
    <dd>A program that takes a source code file (human readable format) and creates from it a new file in a format that can be run by a computer. A compiler is always specific to a programming language, so for compiling a Java source code file, you need a Java compiler. Additionally, a compiler will always check your source code for errors, i.e. if you mistyped something or forgot a necessary symbol like a bracket or a semicolon, and report back to you any error with some hints.</dd>
    <dt><b>Console</b></dt>
    <dd>A program to allowing text-based interaction with a computer. You can run commands, even your own written programs, and interact with them. Every operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS) comes with a console, e.g. on <b>Windows</b> you can open a console by pressing the <b>Start</b> button and then typing in <b>cmd</b>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Command Line</b></dt>
    <dd>Another word for <b>Console</b></dd>
    <dt><b>Source Code</b></dt>
    <dd>The instructions you write that form your program. Source code is written in a <b>human readable format</b>, a <b>programming language</b>. In this class we write our source code in Java. A computer cannot directly execute a program written just in source code as it needs a <b>machine readable format</b>. In order to get to such an format from the source code, programming languages make use of an <b>interpreter</b> or a <b>compiler</b>. Java itself applies a compiler for this</dd>
    <dt><b>Source Code File</b></dt>
    <dd>
    This is a file in that you place your source code. For Java, it should have the file ending <b>.java</b>.
    There are some other rules you need to consider about how to name your source code file or where to place it (TBD: link to that place)
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Terminal</b></dt>
    <dd>Another word for <b>Console</b></dd>
