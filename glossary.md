# Glossary
A collection of common terms used in Java programming

*Compiler*
: A program that takes a source code file (human readable format) and creates from it a new file in a format that can be run by a computer. A compiler is always specific to a programming language, so for compiling a Java source code file, you need a Java compiler. Additionally, a compiler will always check your source code for errors, i.e. if you mistyped something or forgot a necessary symbol like a bracket or a semicolon, and report back to you any error with some hints.

*Console*
: A program to allowing text-based interaction with a computer. You can run commands, even your own written programs, and interact with them. Every operating system (Windows, Linux, MacOS) comes with a console, e.g. on *Windows* you can open a console by pressing the *Start* button and then typing in *cmd*

*Command Line*
: Another word for *Console*

*Source Code*
: The instructions you write that form your program. Source code is written in a *human readable format*, a *programming language*. In this class we write our source code in Java. A computer cannot directly execute a program written just in source code as it needs a *machine readable format*. In order to get to such an format from the source code, programming languages like Java make use of a *compiler*

*Source Code File*
: This is a file in that you place your source code. For Java, it should have the file ending _.java_. There are some other rules you need to consider about how to name your source code file or where to place it

*Terminal*
: Another word for *Console*
