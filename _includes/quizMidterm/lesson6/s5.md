> All calls to _test_ have a problem:
> * the first call to _test_ has the parameters switched - it calls with a _String_ on first position and an _int_ on second => but the _test_ method expects an _int_ as first parameter and a _String_ as second
> * the second call to _test_ fail to handle the returned value correctly - it tries to assign it to a _String_ variable. But the return type of _test_ is declared to be an _int_
> * the third call to _test_ misses one parameter
