> It will print A, B, Z, E, Z.  
> It will start in _main_ and executes the first print statement so _A_ is printed.  
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _2_ and _B_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 2 and _text_ in _test_ is _B_ => so we print _B_.  
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _n_ (i.e. the current value of _n_ in _main_ which is _22_) and _C_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 22 and _text_ in _test_ is _C_ => so we print _Z_. 
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _n_ (i.e. the current value of _n_ in _main_ which has changed to _1__) and _E_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 1 and _text_ in _test_ is _E_ => so we print _E_.  
>  It will then call method _test_ with parameters _33_ and _Y_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 33 and _text_ in _test_ is _Y_ => so we print _Z_.
