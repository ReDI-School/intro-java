> It will print A, B, C, 4, Z, 13.  
> It will start in _main_ and executes the first print statement so _A_ is printed.  
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _2_ and _B_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 2 and _text_ in _test_ is _B_ => so we print _B_. Also we return 3. In _main_, we set _n_ to that value-
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _n_ (i.e. the current value of _n_ in _main_ which is _3_) and _C_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 3 and _text_ in _test_ is _C_ => so we print _C_. We return now 4. In _main_, we set _z_ to 4   
> We now print _z_ i.e. we print _4_.  
> It will then call method _test_ with parameters _n * z_  (i.e. the current value of _n_ times the current value of _z_ in _main_ which is _3 * 4_, i.e. _12_) and _K_ - so when we execute _test_ then _n_ in _test_ is 12 and _text_ in _test_ is _K_ => so we print _Z_. We return now _13_ and set _n_ to that value in _main_.    
> In _main_, we print now the current value of _n_, i.e. we print _13_.
