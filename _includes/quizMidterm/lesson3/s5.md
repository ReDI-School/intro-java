> * _int i = 5.0;_ => this will not help but instead add an additional error (by trying to assign a _double_ value to an _int_ variable)
> * _double d = 2;_ => this would not change anything as _d_ would still be a _double_ (the value _2_ would just be converted to _2.0_)
> * _int result = (int) i / d;_ => this would not help as the casting is applied before division, i.e. this code will first cast _i_ to an _int_ (i.e. no change) and then divide by a _double_ leading again to a _double_ as result
> * _int result = i / (int) d;_ => this would work! The value _d_ is casted to an _int_ (which is allowed as we do it explicitely here) so the division becomes one of two _int_ values resulting in an _int_ as result!
> * _int result = (double) i / d;_ => this would not help as it will just cast _i_ to a _double_ and then divide by a _double_ leading again to a _double_ as result
> * _int result = (int)(i / d);_ => this would help! It still divides an _int_ by a _double_ resulting in a _double_. But then this resulting _double_ is casted to an _int_ (which is allowed as we do it explicitely here) and thus can be assigned to an _int_ variable!
