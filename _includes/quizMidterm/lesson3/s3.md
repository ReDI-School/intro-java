> The program will print first _2.0_ and then _2.5_.  
> The _2.5_ should be clear: we divide two _double_ and assign the result to a _double_.  
> Let's look what happens for the first result:
> * first, a division of two _int_ values happen => the result is just _2_
> * then, this result is assigned to a _double_ variable => as this is a decimal number, the _2_ is converted to be also a decimal number, i.e. _2.0_
