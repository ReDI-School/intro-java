> The program will print first _2_ => we divide two _int_ thus the result is also an _int_ and for divisions of two _int_ any leftover is omitted.  
> Then it will print _2.5_ => we divide two _double_ thus the result is also a _double_ => thus we have a precise result of the division with the decimal value.
