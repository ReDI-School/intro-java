> Follow these rules when using _Scanner_ to read input from the user:
> * always remember the import statement _import java.util.Scanner_ at the beginning of your file
> * when creating a _Scanner_, pass in the _System.in_ by doing _new Scanner(System.in)_
> * use the right method to read input: _next()_ reads a single word and returns it as String, _nextLine()_ a complete line and returns that as String. For other types, use the corresponding method (e.g. _nextInt()_, _nextDouble()_, _nextBoolean()_ etc)
