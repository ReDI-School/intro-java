> The problem is due to how _Scanner_ works internally => reread the part about _Scanner_ in **Lesson 4** for more details.  
> Let's go through the answers:
> * "Change _String country = scanner.nextLine();_ to _String country = scanner.next();'_" => will not change anything, our problem is with reading _fullName_
> * "Change _String fullName = scanner.nextLine();_ to _String fullName = scanner.next();_" => this will allow us to enter something as full name => but it will end up only printing one word (the first name)
> * "Read in the fullName before all other input" => this will fix the issue as the problem we have only happens if we use _nextLine()_ directly after _next()_ (or a corresponding method for another type)
> * "Insert a new line with _scanner.nextLine();_ after _int age = scanner.nextInt();_" => this will also fix the problem - the additional _scanner.nextLine()_ will _clean_ the internal state of our _Scanner_ that reading the _fullName_ will work as epxected
