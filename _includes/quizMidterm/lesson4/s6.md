> The program follows these rules:
> * _A_ is printed always (note that there is a semicolon directly after the preceding _else if_ => thus the printing of _A_ is nit bound to any condition)
> * _B_ is printed if the user enters a number smaller than 10
> * _C_ is printed if the user enters bigger than 50
> * _D_ is printed if the user enters a number smaller or equal 50
>  
> Note: if any _if_, _else_, _else if_ is not followed by a block (i.e. curly braces) the next single statement is executed
