> It will print 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  
> Before the first iteration, _j_ will be set to the value of i, i.e. 5.  
> After that _j_ is printed in each iteration.  
> And _j_ is decremented in each iteration.
> When _j_ becomes 0, the loop stops.  
> Note: when a loop iteration ends, first the decrement happens and then the condition is checked (that's why a 0 is not printed)
