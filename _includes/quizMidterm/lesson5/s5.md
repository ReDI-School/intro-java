> Let's go through the statements:
> * _The program will always print a 0 as the first number_ => this is obviously not true, the first number printed will be the first number the user entered
> * _If the user enters a 42, the program will end immediately without any further output_ => this is false as the loop is executed at least once (_number_ is initialized to 0 so the loop condition is initially true) and the loop body contains as last statement the printing of the number so each number the user enters must be printed
> * _The last number the program prints will always be 42_ => this is correct. The program ends when the user enters a 42 (_number_ becomes 42). This is printed before the loop ends - so the last printed number must be 42
> * _The program may run forever_ => this is true, the program will run forever if the user never enters 42
> * _The program will print nothing_ => this is false, as there is no way that the program will print nothing!
