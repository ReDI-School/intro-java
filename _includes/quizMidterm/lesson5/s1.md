> It will print 0, 2 and 4.  
> Before the first iteration, _i_ will be set to 0.  
> It will be then printed (i.e. the 0 as output).  
> Then _i_ will be incremented by 2 and the next iteration happens - a _2_ is printed.  
> Again, _i_ is incremented by 2 and next iteration happens - a _4_ is printed.  
> After the next increment by 2, _i_ becomes bigger 5 => thus the loop will not be executed anymore.
