> Let's go through the statements:
> * _The program will always print a 0 as the first number_ => this is obviously not true, the first number printed will be the first number the user entered
> * _If the user enters a 42, the program will end immediately without any further output_ => this is true as anytime the user enters a number, the next action is the check of the loop condition. As the loop condition becomes false when _number_ is 42, the print statement would not be executed
> * _The last number the program prints will always be 42_ => this is false as the loop would in this case end before any further print statement
> * _The program may run forever_ => this is true, the program will run forever if the user never enters 42
> * _The program may print nothing_ => this is true, it could happen if the user enters 42 as the first number
