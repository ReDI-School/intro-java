> The valid assignments are i or l to h:
> h is an _long_ and so decimal values cannot be assigned to it as decimal values may contain more _information_ (i.e. the numbers after the decimal point) than a _long_ can represent  
> i can be assigned to h as each value of an _int_ can be represented by a _long_
> As Java does not allow an assignment that leads to a loss of information, these are all not allowed and lead to a compile error!
