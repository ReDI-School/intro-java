> The only valid assignment is the assignment of i to h:
> h is an _int_ and all other types may contain bigger values (i.e. values with more information) than an _int_ can represent.  
> As Java does not allow an assignment that leads to a loss of information, these are all not allowed and lead to a compile error!  
> Note: in such assignments where the content of one variable is assigned to another, the actial value of the variable is not of importance - the types of both variables must allow the assignment (that's why in our example, the assignment of l which is just 1 is also disallowed)
