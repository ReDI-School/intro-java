> The only valid assignment is the assignment of d:
> * i and l cannot be assigned a decimal value (int and long only represent numbers without decimals)
> * b is a boolean and only has _true_ and _false_ as allowed values
> * s is a String and can only be assigned a text (i.e. something surrounded with double quotes)
> * d can take decimal values - but also the _4_ as it can convert it (without loss of information) to a decimal (_4.0_)
