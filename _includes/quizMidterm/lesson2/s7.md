> The only invalid assignment is of d to h
> h is an _float_ and d a _double_ and a _double_ can contain bigger values (i.e. more information) than a _float_ can represent
> As Java does not allow an assignment that leads to a loss of information, this is not allowed and lead to a compile error!  
> Any _long_ or _int_ can be assigned to a _float_ (the decimal part just becomes _.0_)
