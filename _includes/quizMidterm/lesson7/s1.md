> The program will print _3_ and _im_ - here is why:
> The program counts the appearance of the value of variable _sub_ in variable _text_ by using _indexOf_ (this will return the position in the string where the value appears or -1 if not found - thus the loop will run 3 times and _count_ will be 3 at the end).   
> Additionally, every time the term is found, _text_ is updated to only keep the part of the string after the found term.  
> Thus at the end, _text_ will have the value everything after the last appereance of _sub_ , i.e. _im_!
