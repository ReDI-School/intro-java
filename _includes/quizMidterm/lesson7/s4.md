> The program will at the end always print the text as the user has entered it.  
> Note that the _replace_ method does not change the _String_ on that it is called - it creates a new copy of that where the replacements has happened, so _text_ itself is never changed.  
> Additionally the program prints a version of _text_ where each _c_ is replaced by a _d_ if _text_ starts with _a_ and ends with _b_.
