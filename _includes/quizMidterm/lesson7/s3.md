> The program will print _false_ _false_ _false_ _true_ _false_ _true_ _true_.    
> The checks using the _==_ operator will anyway return _false_ as they do not check the content of the _String_ for equality but just if it the same object.  
> The _equals_ method is case-sensitive so it will only return true when _s2_ is changed to lower cases (so the result is equal to _s1_).   
> The _equalsIgnoreCase_ is not case-sensitive so it will return true as long as both strings contains the same letters (no matter if in upper or lower cases)
