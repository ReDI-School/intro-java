> What the program does, depends firstly on the name of the source code file:
> * If the name is _First.java_ it will compile
> * If the name is _Second.java_ it will compile
> * If the name is anything else it will not compile
>
> Remember: a Java source code file needs to contain a class with the same name as the file
>
> What the compiled program does depends on how we run it:
> * if we run it with _java First_ it will execute the _main_ method of the _First_ class and print _Hello world!_
> * if we run it with _java Second_ it will execute the _main_ method of the _Second_ class and print _Hello other world!_
