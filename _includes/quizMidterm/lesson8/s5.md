> The program will print _[a, c, c, a]_.  
> The _test_ basically removes all occurrences of the given _String_ in the given list.  
> It uses _indexOf_ to get the index of the next appearance of the string in the list - if it is -1, the list does not contain anymore the string so the loop ends, else the element at that index is deleted.
> Note: the _remove_ element changes the given list directly!
