> The program will not compile and fail with an error.  
> If you use an _ArrayList_ you can specify what should be the type of elements that it should contain:
> * e.g. _ArrayList<Integer>_ tells that the list can only contain integer values
> * e.g. _ArrayList<String>_ tells that the list can only contain integer values
> Thus you
> * cannot add a value of a different type to such a list
> * need to assign a value you get from the list to a variable of the correct type
> If you do not follow these rules, your program will fail to compile
