> The program will start by printing every second element in the list (i.e. _b_, _d_, _f_).  
> After it printed _f_, the value of _i_ is _4_. The loop will then increment _i_ to _6_.  
> Another loop iteration is executed as _i_ is smaller than the size of the list (the number of elements in the list) which is _7_.  
> Now inside the loop, it is tried to print the list element at index 7.  
> Note that the indices of a list start at index 0, so valid indices for the given list are from 0 to 6. 7 is too big and so the program fails!
