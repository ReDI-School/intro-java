> The program will print _[a, c, d, b, e, f]_.  
> It will first assign the element at index 1 to _s_ , i.e. _s_ becomes _b_.  
> It will then remove the element at index 1 so _words_ will become _[a, c, d, e, f]_. 
> It will then add _b_ at index 3 (i.e. add as 4th element into the list) so _words_ will finally become _[a, c, d, b, e, f]_.
