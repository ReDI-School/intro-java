# Exercises: Strings

## Looking at the Java reference documentation

A reference is a technical documentation that explain all the capabilities available in a class or in a library.
This exists also for every Java class.

- Google for `java string reference` to find the reference documentation of the `String` class
  or visit [](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).
- Try to find a method that does what you need, if it exists.
- Do not use the `Search` box on the website but the search of the browser.
- Read the explanation and how it is used.
- Use this information to solve the following exercises.

### charAt(int index)

Write a program that prints the index and the character for a given word.

```text
Input: Hello
Output:
Index: 0, Character: H
Index: 1, Character: e
Index: 2, Character: l
Index: 3, Character: l
Index: 4, Character: o
```

### compareTo(String anotherString)

Write a program that reads two strings from the user and outputs them in lexicographical order.

```text
Input:
Banane
Ananas
Output: Ananas, Banane

Input:
Vanillepudding
Wirsing
Output: Vanillepudding, Wirsing
```

### endsWith(String suffix)

Write a program that reads two strings from the user and outputs if one word is the suffix (last part) of the other.

```text
Input:
Vanillepudding
pudding
Output: pudding is a suffix of Vanillepudding
```

### contains(String str)

Write a program that reads two strings from the user and outputs if one is a part of the other.

```text
Input:
Vanillepuddingeis
pudding
Output: pudding is a part of Vanillepuddingeis
```

### replace(char oldChar, char newChar) and replace(String target, String replacement)

Use the replace method to decipher this string `lala#lwve#-rwgra22lalang!#<3`

The code is:

 Code  | Letter
-------|------
`w`    | `o`
`#`    | ` ` (space)
`2`    | `m`
`lala` | `i`
`-`    | `p`

### startsWith(String prefix)

Write a program that reads two strings from the user and outputs if one word is the prefix (first part) of the other.

```text
Input:
Vanillepudding
Vanille
Output: Vanille is a prefix of Vanillepudding
```

### substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)

Write a program that reads a string and a number from the input and splits the given string at the index of the number.

```text
Input:
Vanillepuddingeis
7
Output:
Vanille - puddingeis
```

### String.valueOf(int i) and Integer.parseInt()

Write a program that reads a string from the input, converts it to an integer, adds 10, converts it back to a String and prints it.

```text
Input: 2
Output: 12
```

### equals(Object anObject) and equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString)

Write a program that reads two strings from the input and checks if they are equal or only equal with case ignored.

```text
Input:
Wirsing
Wirsing
Output: Equal

Input:
Wirsing
wirsing
Output: Not equal but equal with case ignored

Input:
Wirsing
Vanillepudding
Output: Not equal
```

## Counting characters

Write a program that counts how many 'e's and how many 'u's are in the following text:

```text
Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen TrÃ¤umen erwachte,
fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer verwandelt.
```

To check you solution:

```text
There are 23 'e's and 7 'u's.
```

*NOTE*: uppercase and lowercase characters are different characters.

## Reverse

Write a method that reverses a string.

Examples:

- `java` -> `avaj`
- `Hello world` --> `dlrow olleH`
- `ReDI is a great school!` -> `!loohcs taerg a si IDeR`

*HINT*: create an empty string, fill it and return it.

## Palindrome

Write a method which checks if a word is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word which you can read from both sides (from left to right or from right to left)
and you will get the same word.

Examples are: `Ebbe`, `Anna`, `Kajak` or `Gag`.

*NOTE*: the uppercase and lowercase characters should be considered the same character,
        otherwise the method doesn't work with words starting uppercase.
