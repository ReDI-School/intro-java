# First Steps with Java
In order to program in Java, we first need to answer two questions:
* where do I write my Java code?
* how do I run my Java code and see the results of its execution?

There are severals ways (and several tools) to accomplish that.

We will first use a simple web-based tool to easily get started with writing and running some code (later in class, we will switch to a more advanced tool that is used also by professional developers).
