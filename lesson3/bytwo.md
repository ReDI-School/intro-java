# Exercise: By Two

Create an int named `myNumber` and assign the value `17` to it.
Write code that prints the following, where the last number in each line is the result of a computation.
```java
17 plus 2 is 19
17 minus 2 is 15
17 multiplied by 2 is 34
17 divided by 2 is 8
17 modulo 2 is 1
```

Now change so that you use the number 18 instead of 17 - you should only have to change in one place! 
- The new output should look like below
```java
18 plus 2 is 20
18 minus 2 is 16
18 multiplied by 2 is 36
18 divided by 2 is 9
18 modulo 2 is 0
```


# Exercise: By Three
  - Change the code you wrote in "By Two" so that you use 3 instead of two.
  - Do you have to change in more than one place? How could you change your code so that you only need to change in one place?
  - After you have updated the code so that you only need to change it in one place test it out by changing from 3 to 4.

You should see the following output
```java
18 plus 4 is 22
18 minus 4 is 14
18 multiplied by 4 is 72
18 divided by 4 is 4
18 modulo 4 is 2
```
