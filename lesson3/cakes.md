# Exercise: Cakes

Complete the code for the following problem.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

   // There are 2 cake (one chocolate and one with raspberries).
   // Each cake can be cut into 8 pieces.

   int chocolatePieces = 8;
   int raspberryPieces = 8;
   int totalPieces =
   System.out.println("Total pieces: " + totalPieces);

   // There are 3 people (Mary, Bob and Jo).
   // Mary wants 4 pieces of chocolate cake and 3 pieces of raspberry cake
   // Bob wants 2 pieces of chocolate and 3 pieces of raspberry cake
   // Jo wants 2 pieces of chocolate and 4 pieces of raspberry

   // is there enough chocolate cake?

   int chocoMary =
   int chocoBob =
   int chocoJo =

   int chocoLeftOver =

   if (chocoLeftOver >= 0) {
       System.out.println("There is enough chocolate cake");
   }

   // is there enough raspberry cake?

   int raspMary =
   int raspBob =
   int raspJo =

   int raspLeftOver =

   if (raspLeftOver < 0) {
       System.out.println("There is not enough raspberry cake");
   }

   // if each of the people would want 2 pieces of the chocolate cake, how much of it would be left over?

   chocoLeftOver =

   System.out.println("There are " + chocoLeftOver + " pieces of chocolate cake left over");

   // we get an additional small orange cake (4 pieces) and another hungry Larry.
   // if everyone wants exactly 4 pieces, no matter what flavor, do we have enough?

   int orangePieces = 4;
   totalPieces

   int cakeLeftOver =

   if (cakeLeftOver >= 0) {
       System.out.println("There is enough cake");
   }

    // if Bob ends up having a stomach ache just thinking about all the pieces and leaves,
    // can we divide the pieces up amongst the other 3 people?

    int numberOfPiecesPerPerson =

    System.out.println("Pieces per person: " + numberOfPiecesPerPerson);

    int piecesLeft =

    System.out.println("Pieces left: " + piecesLeft);
}
```
