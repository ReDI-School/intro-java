# Exercise 2: Boolean Type
Please do this exercise in a group with other students.

Go through the questions and discuss the answers within your group.
Write them down/remember them to share later with the class.

{:toc}

## Objective
Goal of this exercise is to get a basic understanding of
* how to work with booleans in Java

## Questions
Try to find the answers within your group (in case of questions/problems => ask one of your teachers!)

### Question 1
Now try again the comparisons you did in the last question of exercise 1 and assign them to a boolean variable.

Print the variable and look at the result: 
what are the possible values a boolean can have?

### Question 2
Let's meet the first operator we can use with one boolean:

this is the **`!`** operator (exclamation mark)

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean b = ?;
        System.out.println(!b);
    }
}
``` 

Try to find out what the **!** operator does by assigning different values to `b`.

### Question 3
Let's meet another operator we can use with two booleans:

this is the **`||`** operator (two vertical bars)

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean a = ?;
        boolean b = ?;
        System.out.println(a || b);
    }
}
``` 

Try to find out what the **`||`** operator does by assigning different values to `a` and `b`.

### Question 4
Let's meet another operator we can use with two booleans:

this is the **&&** operator (two ampersands)

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean a = ?;
        boolean b = ?;
        System.out.println(a && b);
    }
}
``` 

Try to find out what the **`&&`** operator does by assigning different values to `a` and `b`.
