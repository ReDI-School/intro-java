## Notes Exercise 1 
Question 1 => well, just look at the initial hello world, make a guess what it does and run it

Question 2 => hopefully, students understand that we have
* a source code file (*.java) containing the code in Java
* the editor with the content of that file
* a console/output printing the results of the execution

Question 3 => basically they report back what happens in the console
* javac step (compile the code )
* java step (run the code)
* execution result
=> probably students will not know about compile vs run, but they should wonder why there are two things happening

Possibilities to go deeper here if wanted (or at some later point we might want to do that)
* a high-level explanation of the process from Java code in source file, via compilation to class file, then running on JVM
* do the whole compile/run process as exercise outside of repl.it (i.e. create a local file and do all on command line) => to show it is no magic

## Notes Exercise 2
Question 1 to 3: how to print things (same line, new lines)
Question 4: break things, see a compile error
Question 5: students should see the need to write their code (for now) in main
Question 6: leading to introducing comments 

### Notes Exercise 3
students should see that
* the main method is the entry point (and follows specific syntax)
* and main method should be in class with same name as file
