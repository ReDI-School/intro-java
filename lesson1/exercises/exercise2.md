# Exercise 2: Your first code changes in a Java Program
Please do this exercise in a group with other students.

Go through the questions and discuss the answers within your group.
Write them down/remember them to share later with the class.

## Objective
We have run this program:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

We have seen that it prints 
```bash
Hello world!
```
as a result to the console.

Let's try to change our program to print other things.

## Questions
Try to do the code changes together within your group (in case of questions/problems => ask one of your teachers!)

### Question 1
How would you change the program to print out a _Hello_ message to all your group members?

So in the end, it should print
```bash
Hello A, B, C!
```
where _A_,_B_,_C_ would be your names!

Note: if you change the program you might break it (so that it won't run).

If that happens:
can you find out what change broke your program (to share that later in class)?

### Question 2
How would you change the program to print out for each of your group members a _Hello_ message?

So in the end, it should print
```bash
Hello A!
Hello B!
Hello C!
```
where _A_,_B_,_C_ would be your names!

Note: if you change the program you might break it (so that it won't run).

If that happens:
can you find out what change broke your program (to share that later in class)?

### Question 3
Having achieved this, can tell what the line
```java
System.out.println(...);
```
does?

Can you make a guess what each part of this expression means?

### Question 4
What can you observe if you
* remove the double quotes (*"*) either one or both
* remove the semicolon (*;*)
in the program and run it?

Can you explain what happened?

### Question 5
What can you observe if you take the line
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
and place it somewhere else in the Java file and try to run it?

What can you conclude from this?

### Question 6
What can you observe if you just some random text inside
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
}
```
?

Can you think about a reason why you would like to be able to write some "random" text inside of your Java program?
