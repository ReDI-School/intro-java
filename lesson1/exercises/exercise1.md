# Exercise 1: Running a Java Program
Please do this exercise in a group with other students.

Go through the questions and discuss the answers within your group.
Write them down/remember them to share later with the class.

## Precondition
You should have opened the [repl.it](https://repl.it/) website and created a new *Java* repl (do not yet change things).

If not, please visit [this page](/replit) to find out how and come back here after that.

## Objective
Goal of this exercise is to get an understanding of 
* what things do you actually need do write and run a Java program (the ingredients)
* what actually needs to happen so that a Java program is run?

## Questions
Try to find the answers within your group (in case of questions/problems => ask one of your teachers!)

### NOTES (just FYI, will remove for class)
Question 1 => well, just look at the initial hello world, make a guess what it does and run it

Question 2 => hopefully, students understand that we have
* a source code file (*.java) containing the code in Java
* the editor with the content of that file
* a console/output printing the results of the execution

Question 3 => basically they report back what happens in the console
* javac step (compile the code )
* java step (run the code)
* execution result
=> probably students will not know about compile vs run, but they should wonder why there are two things happening

Possibilities to go deeper here if wanted (or at some later point we might want to do that)
* a high-level explanation of the process from Java code in source file, via compilation to class file, then running on JVM
* do the whole compile/run process as exercise outside of repl.it (i.e. create a local file and do all on command line) => to show it is no magic

### Question 1
What do you think the program will do?

If you have an idea, explain why!

Now run the program - does it do what you have expected?

### Question 2
Take another look at your opened *Java* repl.

You can see that it consists of three major parts.

What is the purpose of each part?

What does each contain and what can you do with it?

How are they connected with each other?

### Question 3
Run the program again.

Observe closely what happens.

How many steps do you observe while running your program?

Do you have an idea, what each step is doing?
